<h1>The Best Movies that I have watched to date</h1>
<h2>Listed below is my top 3</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Heart of Stone</h3>
<p>The best in its genre due to its humour and a combination of real action with science fiction.</p>
<h3>Cloudy Meatballs</h3>
<p>Just an awesome piece of animation when you want to spend some time with the kids, chilling on the couch.</p>
<h3>The Lincoln Lawyer</h3>
<p>Well this is a series, but I had to sneak it in here. Who doesn't like a cool story line about someone who always finds a way to win, crashing the competition.</p>
